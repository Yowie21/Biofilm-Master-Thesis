# General information
This repository contains some of the code that I wrote as part of my master thesis. It will be updated regularly until the thesis is finished. For questions, don't hesitate to send me and email at joiegeurts@gmail.com.

# Growing biofilms
The subject of the thesis (and hence the code) is the modelling and numerical simulation of the growth of biofilms. Details may be found in the [thesis proposal](Proposal.pdf).

# How to run the code
The code was developed using [FreeFEM++](https://freefem.org/) and written in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Running it requires version 4.14 of FreeFEM++ or later.

# How to view the simulations
An external tool such as [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) is required to open the simulation files.
